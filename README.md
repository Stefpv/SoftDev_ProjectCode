# SoftDev_ProjectCode

Explain what our project is about. (motivation, usage, etc)
  Currently Resident Advisors and Hall Directors utilize many different resources and websites to do their jobs. Due to the vast amount of specific applications for each task it can often be frustrating when an RA is trying to locate the URL for each application. It can also be confusing when the RA can not remember what each application is used for. With the Residence Hall Staff Portal RAs and Hall Directors will have a streamlined location that contains all the information they need to convey where and why they use each application. By utilizing a user database with a sign in the website will become specific to each staff. With the ability for the hall director or admin to make changes to descriptions and add links, keeping the website updated to reflect how each staff currently uses each site. 
	The Resident Hall Staff Portal will contain a launching page with a sign in. After signing in the page will redirect to a main page specific to each staff with a common menu containing contact information for each staff as well as a page with descriptions and links of each application. Some links will include whentowork which is used to organize community center desk shifts every week, Roompact which is used to keep track of roommate agreements and roommate conflicts in the dorm, StarRez which stores resident information with a campus specific link, and more links to other applications such as where to make duty reports and where to write incident reports. Since most sites are specific to the University of Colorado the user can not just google to find each url. Thus the launch page on Resident Advisor Resources website will become critical to the staff of each year as they are training new RAs and throughout the year as they use each site.
